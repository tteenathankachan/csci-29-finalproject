   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Search.I.T's documentation!
======================================
Requirements are loose due to project flexibility, but as a guideline you should include:

    An intro page to the problem

    An overview of your solution

    Ideally some diagram of the architecture

    Tangible snippets of python code in your discussion

    Some amount of sphinx autodoc, either from your 'real' code, or from toy snippets you include to describe your approach, and some other sphinx cross references.

    A conclusion of the main learnings or contributions of your project

    Your Science Fair presentation should be similar to the content in the writeup, but the writeup is your chance to go deeper into the topics and really explain/demonstrate etc in more depth.
